Not to be sycophantic, but that was first-rate pedantry, many congrats.
I been in the back of a police van before, its very bumpy even at reasonable speeds and smooth roads. If cops wanted to do hard turns and slam on breaks wouldnt surprise me if it killed someone when your handcuffed and surrounded by steel.
