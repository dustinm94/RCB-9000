#Reddit Conversation Bot

I am using reddit comments to create a chat bot, the data I am using is every reddit comment from 2005 to December of 2017.
This is over 1.7 Billion comments, these comments will become the bots vocabulary and will serve as the training data for my bot.

I am storing the reddit comments in a SQLite database.
