Reddit Conversation Bot

I am using reddit comments to create a chat bot, the data I am using is every reddit comment from 2005 to December of 2017.
This is over 1.7 Billion comments, these comments will become the bots vocabulary and will serve as the training data for my bot. I am going to limit which comments are chosen, by only choosing comments that have one upvote on reddit. 

I am storing the reddit comments in a SQLite database.
The website I am using to get the reddit comments from: http://files.pushshift.io/reddit/comments/

I was not able to upload the Database file to github, due to the size limitations. The chatbot database script, is eaasy to set up. If you download some reddit data from the link above you can change the name under timeframe to the name of the file you choose to upload to the DB, also change the system path to your path.

# What I am learning
* How to manipulate JSON data better
* How deep learning works
* AI basics 
* How to use tensorflow
* Gaining experience with Pandas
* Gaining experience with SQlite 
* Gaining experience with CUDA 8.0
* Gaining experience with cudNN 6.0

# Goals
Possibly creating a specific type of chatbot. For example only use engineering subreddits for data, thus making it a chatbot that only talks about engineering related topics and questions. (As you can see, you can apply any subreddit to this)
