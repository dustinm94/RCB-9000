Reddit Conversation Bot

I am using reddit comments to create a chat bot, the data I am using is every reddit comment from 2005 to December of 2017.
This is over 1.7 Billion comments, these comments will become the bots vocabulary and will serve as the training data for my bot. I am goinbg to limit which comments are chosen, by only choosing comments that have one upvote on reddit. 

I am storing the reddit comments in a SQLite database.
The website I am using to get the reddit comments from: http://files.pushshift.io/reddit/comments/

# What I am learning
How to manipulate JSON data, how deep learning works, AI basics, how to use tensorflow.

# Goals
Possibly creating a specific type of chatbot for example only use engineering subreddits for data, thus making it a chatbot that only talks about engineering related topics and questions. (As you can see you can apply any subreddit to this)
